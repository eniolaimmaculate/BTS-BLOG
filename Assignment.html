            BTS are taking sometime to focus on their individualiry 
            and sounds. The two time Grammy award nominee took to Vlive
        on 14th june, 2022 to celebrate BTS at 9 years at their 
        'BTS FIESTA' where they gave a shocking announcement that
        the group will be taking a break on group activities for a while to focus 
        on their individual self. The leader and
        main rapper of the group Kim namjoon said on the live: 
        </p>

 <p>"I always thought BTS was different from other group but the
     problem with K-POP and the whole Idol system is that they don't
     give you time to mature" Kim namjoon commnented.
    </p>
     <p>
     "I think we are going through a rough patch right now. 
     We are trying to find our identity and that's an exhausting and long process" Jimin another menber added.
 </p>

    <p>                         
 There was a mixed reactiuon from fans after the live because the group are at the highest zenith in their career. Some ARMYS 
  came to the conclusion that the group were disbanding while others believe that the group are taking a break to
  explore individual solo projects and wished them luck.

  <p> The maknae of the group Jung Jungkook expalined in his
live due to the outburst of disbandment rumours that the group are not actually disbanding but are just  'going on a break'. 
 BTS agency HYBE also released an official press statement " To be clear BTS are not on hiatus but will take time to 
   explore some solo  projects at this time and remain active in different formats. "

  <p>
        The above calrification from hybe still brought some negative comments as some netizens believe that HYBE
        made the press statement to stop their stock from plummeting. However admist it all HYBE and BTS are following 
      through with their solo plan as lead dancer JHOPE releases two singles 'MORE' and 'ARSON' from his new album 
     "JACK IN THE BOX". 
     </p>
     <br>
     <p> 
        Proir to this some netizens have made some comments that BTS song has gone downhill since their second english single
        "BUTTER" which was released in 2021. A member suga also commented during the live that when they want to write lyrics but
        there is nothing to write anymore and that's one of the resaons they need to go out and experience things and turn them into great
        songs.
         </p>
         <p>
         "We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics 
        is the hardest. what message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore"
        </p>
        <p>
        Anyways ARMYS await the emergence of the new BTS, and are wishing them a quick return filled with great songs 
        and rejuvenated energy. As member V said "BTS will reuinite in the future with synergy like no other"
